            <h1><strong>🖥 Responsive Redesign: LA County Public Works Website</strong></h1>
        </div>
        <div class="page-section-1">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Public services are crucial to the <strong>safety and prospering of communities,</strong> yet the websites that 
            are meant to publicize these services are often <strong>confusing and outdated.</strong> I was inspired to redesign the 
            <a href="https://dpw.lacounty.gov/contact/">Department of Public Works website </a>for my hometown of Los Angeles,
            and to test my design skills in the process.</p>
            <h1>The Original Site: Identifying Usability Problems</h1>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="images/redesign/original-site.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="a screenshot of the original site" style="width: 47%; height: auto;">
                <img src="images/redesign/original-site-2.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="another screenshot of the original site" style="width: 47%; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <h4>After interacting with the original site (pictured above), I documented the following concerns I had with the usability (including efficiency), learnability, and memorability of the site. </h4>
            <details class ="details-example ">
                <summary style="font-size:x-large" >Illogical reading path encouraged</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>[1] In an emergency, a user would need to quickly access instructions in regard to their situation. 
                        Yet, the “urgent requests” section is at the bottom of the page, preventing easy visibility. 
                        While there is a message <em>“Please call 800-675-HELP (4357) for urgent 
                        requests…”</em> at the top of the page, the text is tiny and the link to examples is at the 
                        end of the chunk of text.</li>
                        <br><br>
                    <li>[2] Similarly, the <em>“employee directory”</em> is at the top of the page, which does not make sense as it 
                        is not the most pressing and important information on the page. The small text reading 
                        “employee name” does not provide sufficient or accessible documentation to the user in 
                        regard to how to complete this search. </li>
                </ul>
            </details>
            
            <details class="details-example">
                <summary style="font-size:x-large">Unclear Information</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>[3] There is redundancy in the contact information on the site—one phone number is listed at the top 
                        and another is listed as an option to <em>“Call Public Works”</em> which would likely confuse a user, given 
                        that the numbers are not indicated to be the same or different. There is also an email at the top 
                        of the site and a <em>“Send Public Works an Email”</em> link at the bottom.
                    </li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>[4] The headers do not correctly encapsulate their content. For example, under the <em>"Report A Problem"</em> 
                        header, not all of the options are listed as problems (like <em>“County Operated Airports”</em> and 
                        <em>“Tree Trimming”</em>), making it difficult for users to know where to look for their problem. </li>
                </ul>
            </details>
        
            <details class="details-example">
                <summary style="font-size:x-large">Stylistic Inconsistency</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>[5] The poor textual hierarchy of the site makes it difficult to use and learn, as a reading path is not encouraged. 
                        This can be seen in the differences of header sizes and randomness of italitazation and bolding of text. 
                        Elements of equal importance should have equal size. </li>
                    <br> <br>
                    <li>[6] There is inconsistency in underlining/linking—-the <em>“see examples”</em> link at at the warning near 
                        the header is an underlined link, whereas all of the other links on the site are not underlined until hovered over.
                    </li>
                    <br> <br>
                    <li>[7] The poor contrast on headers (white text on light blue background) make the site difficult to navigate and inaccessible.</li>
                    <br> <br>
                    <li>[8] Search bar inconsistency — There is a button to submit your search for the employee search but not for the overall 
                        site search. This inconsistency makes memorability difficult.</li>
                </ul>
            </details>
           
                <details class="details-example">
                    <summary style="font-size:x-large">Mobile Compatability Concerns</summary>
                    <li>[9] On mobile devices, the site is extremely warped, incompatible, and hard to navigate, leaving users stuck and confused.</li>

                </details>
         
            <details class ="details-example ">
                <summary style="font-size:x-large" >Accessibility Concerns</summary>
                    <p> I used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM WAVE </a> to detect and consider possible accessibility problems with the site.
                    The WAVE report for this site reported 12 errors, 4 contrast errors, and 6 alerts. Some of the errors reported, specifically the 
                    “empty link” and “empty button” warnings did not seem to be actual issues on the site and referenced text that is not meant to 
                    be a link, so I do not agree with those problems. The “contrast errors” and the tools on WAVE to better understand contrast and 
                    text accessibility were very helpful, though. Additionally, the ARIA accessibility analysis was helpful for better unedrstanding 
                    site accessibility.</p>

        <h1>Lessons Learned & Lingering Thoughts</h1>
        <p>This was the first time I've worked on a redesign of an existing site, and I learned quite a bit through this journey--from how 
            to have a critical eye for a website while still recognizing positive elements to preserve, to how to create a solid code plan
            and framework before beginning to build. I was also teaching myself HTML and CSS as I worked through this, and this project 
            was a testiment to how much I love teaching myself new ways of building with code, and also how frusturating it sometimes can be.
