            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>While starting my first-ever React app, I was eager to build something 
                that would test my grasp on key React ideas, like components and 
                state. I decided to render the
                <a href="https://johnmuirlaws.com/product/the-laws-field-guide-to-the-sierra-nevada-2/">
                Laws Field Guide to the Sierra Nevada</a>, a guide tried and true 
                throughout my life as I've spent time in the Sierra Nevada. 
                This app allows for the user to create a field journal and search
                for the wildflowers that they have seen throughout their 
                travels.  </p>

            <h1>The Design Process</h1>
            <p>The design process for this project was pretty linear, as I mapped
                out my desired interface on paper, jotted notes down about the 
                expected backend functionality of my program, and began writing code.
                I iterated through possible designs as I ran into roadblocks,
                and this continues to be a work in progress.

            <h1>Lessons Learned & Lingering Thoughts</h1>
            <p>In all honesty, I should have done a better job of planning and 
                anticipating difficulties while working on this app. I did 
                not have any prior React experience, and this project taught me 
                that while learning by doing is crucial, it does help <bold>very</bold>
                much to watch some tutorials and ground myself in a language 
                before I dive deep into a project. That aside, I did learn so much 
                about back-end app development and had a lot of fun while doing so.
