        <div class="page-section-1">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This is one of the most important projects I have done to help my understanding 
                of not just building beautiful sites, but building sites that make sense.
                I worked on this with a group of three peers, which was a very 
                important excersize in compiling all our brain power to learn 
                something new. It was an amazing experience to get to utilize 
                professional eye tracking software. <br></br>
            </p>

            <div class="page-section-1">
            <h1>Getting ready to test </h1>
            <p>First, we needed to create something to test and collect data 
                from. So, we split into two groups and prototyped two distinct versions 
                of a bakery homepage using Figma. We considered design principles to 
                create two pages with very different layouts, that would presumabely 
                lead to different eye-paths for a user. Here are the pages--very similar
                purposes with very different design--and below are our hypotheses of 
                how user will interact with each.
            </p>
            <div class="flex-row">
                <img src="images/eye/figma.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="a screenshot of the figma" style="width: 55%; height: auto;">
                <img src="images/eye/figma2.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="a screenshot of the figma" style="width: 55%; height: auto;">
            </div>

                <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> we hypothized that for the left site, the the user‚Äôs eyes will be drawn to the images and the large text at the top of the page.
                For the right site, we hypothesized that the user‚Äôs eyes will be drawn towards the ‚ÄúWelcome to the Nested Bakers‚Äù text first followed by the savory, sweet, and drink items just below in that order. Particularly, users will focus on the images of the menu items.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-section-1">
                <h1>The testing process</h1> 
                <p>Our group members as well as two peers gathered in a lab 
                    to collect data. The two test subjects were shown the sites,
                    they were told to think about how they would add bakery items to
                    their order,  
                    and their eyetracking data was collected for us to further analyze.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-section-1">
                <h1>Analyzing the data</h1>
                <p>We manipulated the CSV files of data to generate a heatmap and a replay that depicts the areas where our test subject's gaze was focused. 
                    The heatmaps show where the users focused their eyes for the most time, and
                    the red dots represent the path that their eyes followed throughout all their 
                    time looking at the page
                </p>
                <div class="flex-row">
                    <img src="images/eye/1-heat.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="a screenshot of the figma" style="width: 55%; height: auto;">
                    <img src="images/eye/1-path.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="a screenshot of the figma" style="width: 55%; height: auto;">
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <div class="flex-row">
                    <img src="images/eye/2-heat.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="a screenshot of the figma" style="width: 55%; height: auto;">
                    <img src="images/eye/2-path.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="a screenshot of the figma" style="width: 55%; height: auto;">
                </div>

                <h2>Analysis of these maps</h2>
                <p>The user for the top interface focused mainly on both the title text and the text of the menu items, this partially matched our expectations. The user for the bottom interface looked at every part of the page, and they spent a lot of time reading the text on the menu, this matched most of our expectations. 
                </p>

            <div class="page-section-1">
            <h1>Lessons Learned & Lingering Thoughts</h1>
            <p>We spend almost all day looking at interfaces, online or irl, and 
                I personally had never before spent much time considering <i>how</i>
                we look at these things. This project was a testiment to how important design is,
                how important it is to test and iterate through designs if you want your user 
                to <i>really see and understand</i> the message or function 
                you are trying to get across.
